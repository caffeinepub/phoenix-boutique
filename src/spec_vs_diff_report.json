  "summary": "REQ-51 is partially implemented: a release-build script and signing placeholder files were added, and the script copies the Gradle release APK to a clearly named output file. However, the provided diff summary is truncated for the main build guide, so it is not fully verifiable that the APK output location/path and signing steps are documented as required. The diff also includes substantial unrelated frontend feature work and modifications to an explicitly immutable path (frontend/src/main.tsx), which were not requested for the APK-artifact task.",

      "requirement": "Document the single, clearly named release APK output file and its location/path for maintainers, and clearly state required values/steps for release signing when the keystore is not committed.",
      "reason": "While the build script copies to build-outputs/PhoenixBoutique-release.apk and prints the location, the primary documentation file (ANDROID_RELEASE.md) is truncated in the diff summary right after 'From the frontend/ directory, run:', so it is not confirmable from the provided evidence that the required output path and signing steps are documented there as acceptance criteria require.",
